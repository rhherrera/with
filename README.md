# with test
You will see that there are 3 files: `concat_way.py` , `print_if_way.py` , `one_line_way.py`

To run each of them only python is needed and you just need to run on a terminal:

`python <name_of_file.py>`

concat_way.py , print_if_way.py are very similar, the difference is that one concats on a variable and print at the end and the other make prints inside the conditional.

one_line_way.py is the shorter one is a one line statement plus the `if __name__` to make it as a main program for the interpreter.
